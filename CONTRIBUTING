Only 5-word lines of Lorem Ipsum may be appended to README.md.  
Each line should be followed by two spaces to ensure it displays properly in Markdown.  
Go to https://www.lipsum.com/, leave the number at the default of "5", select "words", and click "Generate Lorem Ipsum".  
The easiest way to do this is to copy-and-paste into this command, replacing 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.' with your line:  
`echo 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.  ' >> README.md`
